# STUDENT DIRECTORY PROGRAM
Week 4 of Makers pre-course

Please feel free to clone the repo to run the program and see it for yourself. Please feel free to raise any issues with broken code or any improvement comments you have.

Upon cloning the repo, run the program in your command line with % ruby directory\_interactive.rb

If you choose to save a file it will automatically create a directory in your folder where the repo is cloned - saved\_directories. All saved files will be stored there

A default csv file with information is downloaded as part of the clone - .default\_november\_cohort.csv - you can delete this if you want.

Older iterations of the program are:
- directory.rb
- directory\_alt\_exercises.rb
