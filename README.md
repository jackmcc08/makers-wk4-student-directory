# STUDENT DIRECTORY PROGRAM

##Week 4 of Makers pre-course

## Introduction

This command line app is built entirely in Ruby as part of the Makers Pre-course. It was developed to meet all the specifications set out in the pre-course and then taken a step further to make the app more usable. It includes:
- Continuous looping until the user decides to quit (no arbitrary code exits)
- Handles incorrect user input throughout where progress is not allowed until a correct input has been made.
- Incorporates confirmation of action so the user knows what has happened.
- Incorporates a wider variety of display options.
- Creates a bespoke csv save folder to help manage the program files and keep the repository tidy.

## Using the program

Please feel free to clone the repo to run the program and see it for yourself. Please raise an issue with any broken code or any improvement comments you have.

Upon cloning the repo, run the program in your command line with % ruby directory\_interactive.rb

If you choose to save a file it will automatically create a directory in your folder where the repo is cloned - saved\_directories. All saved files will be stored there.

A default csv file with information is downloaded as part of the clone which you can use immediately with the display functions- '.default\_november\_cohort.csv' - you can delete this if you want.

## Other details

Older iterations of the program are (not required - can be deleted):
- directory.rb
- directory\_alt\_exercises.rb
- spell\_check.rb (was created as part of an exercise)

There are also two files quine.rb and quine\_final.rb which includes three solutions for quines, 2 of which are a method to print out the full source code of any program it is run in, the other is a true quine.
